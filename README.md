## How to use

1. Clone it on local machine, then open ```index.htm```. No local server needed.
  * Chrome is recommended. Other browsers (e.g. Firefox) may crash.
  * Scripts are intentionally loaded synchronously, because this project is designed to be opened directly from local machine. Modern browsers impose CORS restrictions, so functions like ```$.getScript()``` will fail.
2. You may change ```img_dir``` to your own image directory.
